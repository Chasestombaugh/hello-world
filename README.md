Hello! My name is Chase Stombaugh and I am a Computer Science major attending Boise State University. I was originally a Biology major but I realized that it wasn't for me in my third year but I was loving the computer science class that I was it, CS111 - Introduction to programming. I was on track to graduate in 5 years at BSU with a bachelor's degree in Biology since I work ~30 hours a week at my job at Costco, but the switch puts me back a bit. In my free time I love being able to play games with my friends, and my favorite game to play with them is Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. When I'm playing solo, I like ot play Dying Light 2 as I'm on my third playthough, and this will be my most in-depth run to date.
